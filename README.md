## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage, the API enforces rate limits:

- **Free Plan**: 1,000 requests per month.
- **Pro Plan**: 350,000 requests per month.

Exceeding these limits will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

---

## Error Codes

The API may return the following HTTP status codes:

- `200 OK`: The request was successful.
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was malformed or missing required parameters.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failed due to invalid `access_key` or `secret_key`.
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

---

## Notes

- Ensure your `access_key` and `secret_key` are kept confidential.
- Use the appropriate HTTP status codes to handle responses effectively.
- For bulk email validations or higher rate limits, consider upgrading to a higher plan.
